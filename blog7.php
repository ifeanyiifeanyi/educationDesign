                          <p class="mb-15">Persons of other faith or ecclesial communities could study or teach in Catholic schools. Given that the Catholic Church is a welcoming institution, she does not discriminate based on race, ethnicity or religion. The very presence of non-Catholics in Catholic schools could be an example of the interreligious dialogue that Catholic schools promote. The religious freedom of staff and students is being respected according to laid down norms. Sunday worship is according to religious persuasion unless otherwise personally, desired by Non-Catholics to join in Catholic liturgy, while other moments of prayer is done together in line with the culture of the school. While Catholic schools are places for proselytization, care should be taken not to compromise the identity or mission of Catholic schools.</p>
                          <p class="mb-15">Best practices and procedures in addition to sufficient sensitivity are being employed  followed, and shown accordingly, in the admission of non-Catholic students and teachers for two reasons: 1) so that their religious rights will not be violated; (2) So that the Catholic identity of the school and the school religious practices are preserved.</p>
                          
                         
                         
                          <p class="mb-15">The Archdiocesan Education office works hard to explain this important issue to new school managers/principals. Such persons have right to know their rights, freedom, expectations and obligations in a Catholic school. This initial clarification is necessary to avoid expectations that may lead to avoidable and unnecessary conflicts or complaints.</p>
